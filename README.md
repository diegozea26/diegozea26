## Hi there 👋 I'm Diego

### About me
I’m a lifelong learner transitioning into **Business Intelligence and Data Analytics**, with a strong background in education.

For over 12 years, I worked as a teacher, academic coordinator, and curriculum strategist, where I developed a deep interest in data-informed decision-making, performance analysis, and learning optimization.

Today, I’m applying that same analytical mindset to data projects, building insights through visualization, exploration, and storytelling to support smarter organizational decisions.
